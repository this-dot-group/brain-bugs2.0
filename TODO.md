## TO DO List

* time is very high for testing gameplay screens

* Update the urls for your own ip address
  * StartGame Screen
  * Home screen
  * gameInfo Reducer

***************************

* Look into React memory leak issue

### Game Play Screen
* Get questions into server for single player game

* On gameplay screen, working towards some type of progress bar / visual indication to the user that theyve selected an answer and it will be submitted after a short period of time. for ex: user holds finger on answer (in a Pressable), onPressIn starts a "progress bar" that indicates time to submission. Countdown going on in the background as well.



## UPDATED Game Play notes 02/03/20

* Issue with being able to press and onLongPress same answer multiple times, affecting the ready property in server ( Test to see if the user can do this on the same answer)
* Chat functionality at end
* Option for rematch or lobby at end 
* Need to make other pressables (incorrrect answers dissapear when rendering correct answer)


## Style section (TODO)
* React native ellipsis package has style props (see npm package site)
