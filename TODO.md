Josh:
- Sound - fill out for more actions, look into changing moving sounds to root level so we can use sounds on screen changes
- Look into single player issue - is it also a multiplayer issue? What is causing it?
- X - Update scoring, so you get as many points as seconds left
- Don't allow submit unless an answer is selected
- Fix rematch for single player or remove

Tia:
- Push notification 

## Code
- When one person leaves, let other user know that they have left
- if you dont answer a question, when the correct answer moment occurs it looks like you answered correctly (because no other option is selected)
  - improve selected/submitted feedback (raining down smileys/sads)
- clean up package.json unused dependencies

## New Features
* Chat functionality at end
* Emoji decorations 

## Styling/Content
- Responsive font size for answer pressables and question on GameScreen
- Content for all pages, such as how to play instructions 
- Logo/img/etc

## Improvement ideas
* Single player fake opponent scoring (right now they get it right 50% of time, random # for points)
- Change one player game title to 'practice round'?

## Manuel Testing
- Single Player Works
- Multi Player
- Each one First
- Each One Second
- Works with both Game Maker and Game Joiner 

## Possible bugs
- Single player does not work unless it is the first game, maybe same with multiplayer
