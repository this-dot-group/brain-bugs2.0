## TO DO List
***************************

 # BUG TRACKING
 - keep an eye for repetitive errors, add to bug list below
 - eventually add error catchers in server wherever we notice errors that will somehow just end the game and reset at the beginning

Josh:
- [x] don't show "waiting for other player" if opponent has already submitted
- [ ] Fix drawer again
- [ ] Content audit for all pages, such as how to play instructions, content for alerts (does the wording sound ok in these?)

New ideas:
- [ ] Fix all "Create a game" modals to account for SafeAreaView
- [ ] Account for SafeArea in calculating screen size
- [ ] Center text for trivia while you wait
- [ ] Maybe make a custom alert
- [ ] Find or create pixel icons

Tia: 
- [ ] Start adding colors to app
- [ ] Bug crawling animation
- [ ] Test safe area view on android


For Future
- code improvements
  - destructure props
  - make some shared components/variables
    - answer buttons
  - Delete unused things
   - hourglass gif
   - Emoji.js
  - Clean Up GameScreen code
 

## Possible bugs

## Code / Fit & finish
- clean up package.json unused dependencies
- Increase waiting room screen time (I had reduced at some point to speed up testing. can revisit all countdown timer # seconds)


## New Features
* Emoji decorations 

## Styling/Content
- Animation Ideas
 - Bug crawling in background - homescreen, endscreen
 - Feedback copying private game code
 - Bounce or something on pixel button
 
 

- Logo/img/etc
- if you dont answer a question, when the correct answer moment occurs it looks like you answered correctly (because no other option is selected)
- improve selected/submitted feedback (raining down smileys/sads)
- More sounds (ticking sound)
- need to fix alert language in redirectGameJoinerToLobby   : )
- add the following to app.json to customize notifications
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "icon": "./local/path/to/myNotificationIcon.png",
          "color": "#ffffff",
          "sounds": ["./local/path/to/mySound.wav", "./local/path/to/myOtherSound.wav"],
          "mode": "production"
        }
      ]
    ],
- Feedback patterns to user while waiting for opponent response
    - waiting room screen: loading spinner
    - gameplay: Waiting for other user... text
    - game end, rematch request: "Rematch" changes to "Requesting..." 
    - if start game options are still loading: ____________
- Dropdown buttons should be taller or wider for longer category titles
- Trophy is not a consistent size
- Issue with Sounds - I think when it starts on mute
- style consistency
  - for ex- all headings in caps?

## Improvement ideas
* Single player fake opponent scoring (right now they get it right 50% of time, random # for points)
- Any special way to handle a tie?
- Weird apple shapes over the screen

## Manuel Testing
- Single Player Works
- Multi Player
- Each one First
- Each One Second
- Works with both Game Maker and Game Joiner 

  - Two Player, private code
    - phone makes code, sim joins (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says yes (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says no (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says yes (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says no (OK)
    - sim makes code, phone joins (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says yes (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says no (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says yes (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says no (OK)

  - Two Player (SIM v PHONE)
    - phone start game, sim joins (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says yes (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says no (OK)
        - phone leaves during game (OK)
        - sim leaves during game (NO ALERT ON PHONE)
