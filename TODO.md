## TO DO List

* Update the urls for your own ip address
  * StartGame Screen
  * Home screen

* When someone chooses a game to join, it should remove that game from list of available ones (thats used to populate that screen)


* PrivateGame modal:
 * Start by creating private game to show code, then go to join private game and type invalid code
 * When you hit 5 digits, 'invalid code' shows but doesn't go away (setTimeout?)
 * Go button should only show when code is valid (right now its there all the time)




* clean up inline styling in StartGame (and prob others) file, move out to main style file


* Look into React memory leak issue
