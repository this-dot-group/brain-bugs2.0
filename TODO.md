## Code
- Lil research re possible sound effects
- BUG - Countdown does not continue while changing selections
- Let rematch requester know if the other person says no
- When one person leaves, let other user know that they have left
- transition from question to question, "waiting for 1 player to answer..." lingers after other player has answered, and while the correct answer is showing
- if you dont answer a question, when the correct answer moment occurs it looks like you answered correctly (because no other option is selected)

## New Features
* Chat functionality at end
* Emojis
* Alert to user who makes a public, 2P game and is waiting. There should be some sort of alert to let them know when someone joined their game


## Styling/Content
- Content for all pages, such as how to play instructions 
- Could have a Submit button that is greyed out/disabled until the user chooses an answer
- React native ellipsis package has style props (see npm package site)
- Logo/img/etc

## Improvement ideas
* Single player fake opponent scoring
- Change one player game title to 'practice round'?
* Give higher score for a faster response
