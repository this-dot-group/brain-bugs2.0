## TO DO List
***************************

 # BUG TRACKING
 - keep an eye for repetitive errors, add to bug list below
 - eventually add error catchers in server wherever we notice errors that will somehow just end the game and reset at the beginning

Josh:
- [ ] Add more sounds
- [ ] Deploy backend
- [ ] Answer buttons aren't wrapping to two lines anymore

New:
Q: is the linting not doing enough work?

Tia: 
- [x] Sometimes getting 429 Error (too many requests). Is that new? 
  - [x] Change num questions options to 5/10/15
  - [x] Fetch 5 more than requested to handle needing to remove the ones with Q/As that are too long (so that we dont need to fetch super quickly, we have a few questions of wiggle room)
  - [ ] Keep the 5 second timeout as backup, streamline loading screens (this is LoadingScreen coming from WaitingRoom redirect, and then HowToPlay screen. might look better to get rid of spinner on HowToPlay and ut crawling bugs instead?)
- [ ] Refactor player name/score/check/x area (see slide 8 in canva)
- [x] Bug crawling animation
  - [x] Use GIMP to rotate the images so theyre pointing to the right (should just work, but if not look into getAngle and getHypotenus)
  - [ ] Change size of bug!
- [ ] upgrade react native to 0.69.9


For Future
- code improvements
  - destructure props
  - make some shared components/variables
    - answer buttons
  - Delete unused things
   - hourglass gif
   - Emoji.js
  - Clean Up GameScreen code
 

## Possible bugs

## Code / Fit & finish
- clean up package.json unused dependencies
- Increase waiting room screen time (I had reduced at some point to speed up testing. can revisit all countdown timer # seconds)

## Styling/Content
- Animation Ideas
- Logo/img/etc
- if you dont answer a question, when the correct answer moment occurs it looks like you answered correctly (because no other option is selected)
- improve selected/submitted feedback (raining down smileys/sads)
- More sounds (ticking sound)
- need to fix alert language in redirectGameJoinerToLobby   : )
- add the following to app.json to customize notifications
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "icon": "./local/path/to/myNotificationIcon.png",
          "color": "#ffffff",
          "sounds": ["./local/path/to/mySound.wav", "./local/path/to/myOtherSound.wav"],
          "mode": "production"
        }
      ]
    ],

## Improvement ideas
* Single player fake opponent scoring (right now they get it right 50% of time, random # for points)
- Any special way to handle a tie?

## Manuel Testing
- Single Player Works
- Multi Player
- Each one First
- Each One Second
- Works with both Game Maker and Game Joiner 

  - Two Player, private code
    - phone makes code, sim joins (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says yes (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says no (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says yes (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says no (OK)
    - sim makes code, phone joins (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says yes (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says no (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says yes (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says no (OK)

  - Two Player (SIM v PHONE)
    - phone start game, sim joins (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says yes (OK)
        - phone asks for rematch, sim says no (OK)
        - phone leaves during game (OK)
        - sim leaves during game (NO ALERT ON PHONE)
    - sim starts game, phone joins
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says yes (OK)
        - sim asks for rematch, phone says no (OK)
        - sim leaves during game (ALERT SHOWS ON PHONE, HAVE TO CLICK SEVERAL TIMES)
        - phone leaves during game (NO ALERT ON SIM)

  - Two Player (PHONE vs IOS)
    - phone start game, iPhone joins
        - phone leaves during game (OK)
        - iPhone leaves during game (NO ALERT ON PHONE)
    - iPhone starts game, phone joins
        - iPhone leaves during game (ALERT SHOWS ON PHONE TWICE)
        - phone leaves during game ()

    - Push Notifications
      - phone makes game, leaves while waiting, sim joins ()
      - iphone makes game, leaves while waiting, android joins ()
