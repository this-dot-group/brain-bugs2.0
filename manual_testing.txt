  - Red badge should show up
    - If you haven't opened the chat yet
    - If a message comes after you close the chat
  - Red badge should not show up
    - If you close the modal after receiving a message
    - When the rematch alert closes the modal
  - Chat bubbles are on their correct side. (This depends on the socket id, so may not work after code refresh)
  - Input should clear on send - doesn't seem to work on sim
